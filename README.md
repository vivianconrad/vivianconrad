# Hi, I'm Vivian! 👋

I'm Vi, a software developer with a passion for creating innovative solutions to complex problems. I have 4 years of experience in Java, 3 years of experience in python, and I'm currently working with React.

## 🚀 About Me
I'm a frontend developer with experience in Java and Python. I am currently focusing on React and building intuitive user interfaces that enhance the user experience.

I am a recent graduate from Creighton University, where I gained valuable skills in software development and web design. During my time at Creighton, I completed various projects that involved creating responsive websites, implementing RESTful APIs, and building dynamic web applications.

My proficiency in Java and Python allows me to work on the full stack of web development. I love to collaborate with others and contribute to open source projects, which enables me to continue learning and growing as a developer.

I am seeking a full-time position in Chicago, where I can apply my skills and expertise in a fast-paced and challenging environment. If you're interested in learning more about me or would like to discuss any opportunities, please don't hesitate to reach out!
